=== ENHANCED P&L TRACKING APPROACH ===

Current Issue:
- Trades are recorded when orders are placed, not when positions close
- P&L is set to 0 and never updated
- No connection between entry and exit trades

Proper Implementation Needed:
1. Track position entries (BUY orders)
2. Match with position exits (SELL orders)
3. Calculate realized P&L: (exit_price - entry_price) * quantity
4. Update performance metrics with actual P&L

Alternative Quick Fix:
- Use Alpaca's portfolio history endpoint
- Calculate daily P&L from portfolio value changes
- Update metrics based on actual account performance

This requires:
1. Modifying trade_executor.py to track position lifecycle
2. Adding position tracking to performance_tracker.py
3. Using Alpaca's portfolio history API for accurate P&L

The current fix adds basic P&L checking, but a full implementation
would require position lifecycle tracking.
