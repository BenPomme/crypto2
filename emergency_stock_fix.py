Emergency workaround for stock symbols not loading

=== STOCK SYMBOL LOADING ISSUE ===

Current behavior:
- STOCK_SYMBOLS env var = 'SPY,QQQ,AAPL,TSLA' ✓
- StockTradingSettings.stock_symbols = '' ✗

Root cause:
- env_prefix="STOCK_" conflicts with env="STOCK_SYMBOLS"
- Pydantic is looking for STOCK_STOCK_SYMBOLS

Fix deployed but not active yet.

Temporary workaround options:
1. Set STOCK_STOCK_SYMBOLS='SPY,QQQ,AAPL,TSLA' in Railway
2. Wait for deployment with env_prefix removed
3. Use default symbols in code as fallback

The fix removing env_prefix should resolve this permanently.
