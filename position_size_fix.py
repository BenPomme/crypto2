Position Sizing Fix
Addresses the issue of oversized positions exceeding buying power
"""

# The main issue is in position_sizer.py line 417-420:
# When stop loss is very close to entry, it creates huge positions
# Example: 2% risk on $100k with 0.5% stop = $200 / 0.005 = $40,000 position!

# We need to add additional constraints:
# 1. Max position should not exceed available buying power
# 2. Apply leverage limits properly for crypto
# 3. Ensure proper error handling when orders fail
