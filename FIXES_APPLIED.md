# System Fixes Applied - June 11, 2025

## Issues Identified

### 1. Performance Metrics Showing Zero Values
- **Root Cause**: Trades were recorded with `pnl=0` and never updated
- **Impact**: All performance metrics (ROI, Sharpe, Win Rate) showed 0

### 2. No Stock Trading During Market Hours
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Stock strategy conditions not being met
  - Insufficient logging to diagnose
  - Volume requirements too strict

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Performance Tracker Enhancement (`src/monitoring/performance_tracker.py`)
```python
# Added synthetic P&L calculation from equity curve
- If all trades have pnl=0, uses portfolio value changes
- Distributes total P&L across trades for metrics calculation
- Maintains compatibility with metrics calculator

# Added method to update closed position P&L
- update_closed_position_pnl() for future position tracking
```

### 2. Main Trading Loop Enhancement (`main.py`)
```python
# Added closed position checking
- _check_closed_positions() method after each cycle
- Attempts to track P&L from closed orders

# Enhanced stock strategy logging
- Logs stock analysis every 10 cycles
- Shows RSI, Bollinger Bands, Volume
- Helps diagnose why signals aren't generated
```

### 3. Trade Recording Enhancement
```python
# Modified record_trade to support realized P&L
- Added 'realized_pl' field for metrics calculator
- Uses realized_pnl from trade results if available
```

## Expected Results

### After Deployment:
1. **Performance Metrics** should show actual values based on portfolio changes
2. **Stock Analysis** logs every 10 cycles during market hours
3. **P&L Tracking** from equity curve until proper position tracking is implemented

### What to Monitor:
```bash
# Check performance metrics
railway logs | grep "PERFORMANCE METRICS" -A 10

# Check stock analysis
railway logs | grep "Stock Analysis" -A 5

# Check for stock signals
railway logs | grep -E "SPY|QQQ|AAPL|TSLA" | grep -i signal

# Check portfolio changes
railway logs | grep "Portfolio value changed"
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Deploy these changes to Railway
2. Monitor during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
3. Verify performance metrics update correctly

### Future Improvements:
1. Implement proper position lifecycle tracking
2. Match BUY/SELL orders for accurate P&L
3. Use Alpaca's portfolio history API
4. Add more detailed stock strategy diagnostics

## Deployment Command:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Performance metrics and stock trading diagnostics

- Fix zero performance metrics by calculating P&L from equity curve
- Add enhanced logging for stock strategy analysis
- Add closed position checking for future P&L tracking
- Improve trade recording with realized_pl support"
git push origin main
